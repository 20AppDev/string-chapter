# Ruby Practice

Run your Ruby file by typing `ruby ` and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

If we want to run `string_multiplication.rb`, we can write the command:

```bash
ruby string_multiplication.rb
```

To re-run this command, you can use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to look at the history of commands you've run in a Terminal.

## String

### string_multiplication.rb
Should output:
```
"HoHoHo"
```
using String multiplication.

(Don't just print the String literal `"HoHoHo"`)

### string_case.rb
Should output:
```
"HELLO friends AnD FaMiLy"
```
using a combination of the `upcase`, `downcase`, and `swapcase` methods.

### string_chomp.rb
Shoud output:
```
"Hello!"
```
using the given starting variable.

### string_gsub.rb
Should output:
```
"put spaces in between these words"
```
using the given starting variable.

### string_strip.rb
Should output exactly
```
"no external whitespace"
```
using the given starting variable.

### string_gets.rb
Write a program that gets a name (e.g. "alice") from the user, capitalizes it, and then says "Hello, Alice!"

Should work similarly to the following:
```
"What's your name?"
jelani
"Hello, Jelani!"
```
